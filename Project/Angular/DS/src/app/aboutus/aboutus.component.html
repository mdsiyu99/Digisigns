Language is the normal way for humans to communicate. In this world, people use different languages to communicate with 
each other in school, college, job place, home etc… Like that, the deaf people too use a language to communicate. 
But, most of the people do not know about this language. Because they are not aware about this language. It could be the 
responsibility of us deaf people to provide awareness about sign language and also to develop it fully. This website is a 
part of doing so. <br><br>


Degree courses deal with many technical terms. There are many terms in Banking and IT. But we do not have signs for all 
these terms. The aim of this website is to create a repository for technical term signs related to Banking and IT. This 
application will help to collect signs for words from users, which can be voted and then approved by the admin. And this 
sign can be followed in future.
